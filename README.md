# pokemon-draft-league-match-assistant
## This script was designed to help in Pokémon draft leagues where all Pokémon's speed stats need to be compared for optimal EV/nature allocation.

Say you have a match coming up and want to figure out what everyone's speeds are so that you can reach the exact speed stat you need to outspeed the next slowest mon.

It will also show you base stats and effective stats, as well as speed while holding a Choice Scarf (or just at +1). No more checking PokemonDB for each individual stat and writing them all on a notepad!


This script uses the following Python libraries: requests, math, and tabulate.
